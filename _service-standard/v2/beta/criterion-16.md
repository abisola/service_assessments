### Prompts

* Have you identified the behaviour, characteristics and dependencies of the new service and the factors that influence the choice of metrics and data sources for those metrics?
* Have these metrics changed since alpha review, and if so why?
* How are you measuring the performance of the existing (if applicable) and beta service across digital, non-digital and assisted-digital channels?
* How are you capturing user journey data for the new service during beta?
* How are you collecting cost per transaction (or equivalent*) data during beta?
* How are you collecting usage volume or digital take up data during beta?
* How are you collecting cost per transaction (or equivalent*) data during beta?
* How are you collecting other identified metrics data during beta?
* How are data analytics and user research being used to identify % of users who could channel shift and who will need assisted digital services?
* What are their plans for engaging with service users, delivery partners or other stakeholders during the beta phase?

### Evidence

* Show how they are collecting completion rate (or equivalent*) data during beta.
* Show how they are collecting other metrics data (including journey stage information) during beta.
