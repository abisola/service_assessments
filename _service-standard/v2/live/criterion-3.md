### Prompts

* Can you talk us through the team that was in place during beta and what the team will look like after the service is live?
* Was the service manager empowered to make decisions during beta and will this remain be the case after the service goes live?
* Is the service manager the single responsible person with the power and knowledge to make decisions to improve the service day-to-day after the service is live?
* Were there any gaps in the team during beta and how are you addressing these for after the service goes live?
* Do you have plans to sustain the team after the service goes live?
* Is there an operating model in place for the live service?
* Are you using external people and if so, how are you approaching transferring skills and knowledge to the team after the service is live?
* Is there a separation of key roles?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to

* Clearly explain the structure of the team during beta and after the service goes live (the following should be either in the team or available to the team depending on the scale of the service - service manager, product manager, delivery manager, tech architect and lead, assisted digital lead, designer, user researcher, developers, content designer, web ops, product analyst)
* Show they were empowered to make decisions during beta and will continue to do so after the service is live
* Show there are no gaps in the team or explain how they will address any gaps
* Show that the team will be sustained to continuously improve the service after it goes live
* Show they fully understand the service
* Explain how they will transfer knowledge from external people to the team
* Show that there is a separation of key roles (i.e. the same person is not performing multiple roles within the service)
