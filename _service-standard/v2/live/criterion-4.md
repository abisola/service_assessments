### Evidence

Service Manager able to

* Clearly explain how the service has worked in an agile way during beta and will continue to do so after the service is live, giving examples of using agile tools and techniques.
* Explain how the service has reviewed and iterated their processes to be responsive during beta.
* Explain how the team has used agile tools and techniques to communicate within the team during beta.
* Give an example of how the service has responded to user research and usability testing during beta.
* Show that governance is proportional, not imposed, is based on clear and measurable goals, “go and see” rather than “wait and hear”, a clear focus on managing change and risk in real time rather than at arbitrary points, human centred not process centred.
