### Prompts

* Have you changed the behaviour, characteristics and dependencies of the new service and the factors that influence the choice of metrics and data sources for those metrics?
* Have these metrics changed since beta assessment and if so why?
* How are you measuring the performance of the existing (if applicable) and new service across digital, non-digital and assisted-digital channels?

### Evidence

Using the Performance Platform dashboard, the Service Manager is able to:

* Explain and show how they are reporting user satisfaction on their dashboard
* Explain how they are planning to increase user satisfaction after the service goes live
* Explain who will monitor user satisfaction after the service is live
* Explain and show how they are reporting completion rates (or equivalent*) on their dashboard
* Explain how they are planning to increase completion rates after the service goes live
* Explain who will monitor completion rates after the service is live
* Explain and show how they are reporting cost per transaction (or equivalent*) on their dashboard
* Explain how they are planning to achieve a low cost per transaction after the service goes live
* Explain who will monitor cost per transaction after the service is live
* Explain and show how they are reporting digital take up on their dashboard, and explain how it measures channel shift
* Explain how they are planning to increase digital uptake after the service goes live
* Explain realistic planning to increase digital uptake (thereby reducing reliance on assisted digital) after the service goes live
* Explain who will monitor digital take up after the service is live
* Explain and show other additional metrics supporting the service on their dashboard
* Explain how they are planning to use these metrics to improve the service
* Explain who will monitor these metrics
* Demonstrate that delivery partners and other stakeholders are actively promoting/supporting digital delivery
* Identify future metrics and how they will be used to improve the service
* Outline a timescale when these metrics will be available


* for non-transactional user journeys
